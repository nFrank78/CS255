•	Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The client was Liam, the owner of DriverPass, and he wanted me to design a website for an online driving school that was accessible via web browser on a computer or mobile device. They wanted the website to offer online training material and practice tests as well as the option to purchase in-person driving training.

•	What did you do particularly well?

I think I laid out the requirements for this application very well. This allowed the client a better understanding of the requirements for the system and a better analysis of the cost and time that would go along with the development of the application.

•	If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I think I might revisit some of my diagrams so that I could include a bit more detail so that the full process could be easier to understand. I might also spend a bit more time thinking about all of the functional and nonfunctional requirements so that I could have an even more thorough analysis of the design to present to the client.

•	How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I interpreted the user’s needs by sitting down with them, asking pertinent questions and having them detail all of the different functionality that they wanted included in the application. It is extremely important to consider the user’s needs when designing because if the user struggles with the application or find’s it lacking in needed functions then the user will simply not use it. The purpose is design a product that is useful to the user and provides a helpful service that is at least somewhat exclusive to your product or is better polished.

•	How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

I would approach designing the software by working on the most important functions first and making sure they work as intended and then put them all together. I would test as I go and once the software is released, I would make sure to keep up on maintenance and responding to user feedback to better improve the system.
